/*You are given two integers 'n', and 'm'.



Calculate 'gcd(n,m)', without using library functions.



Note:
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers 'n' and 'm' is the largest positive number that divides both 'n' and 'm' without leaving a remainder.


Example:
Input: 'n' = 6, 'm' = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
Here, gcd(4,6) = 2, because 2 is the largest positive integer that divides both 4 and 6.


Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
9 6


Sample Output 1:
3


Explanation of sample output 1:
gcd(6,9) is 3, as 3 is the largest positive integer that divides both 6 and 9.

Sample Input 2:
2 5


Sample Output 2:
1


Expected Time Complexity:
Try to solve this in O(log(n)) 


Constraints:
0 <= ‘n’ <= 10^5
